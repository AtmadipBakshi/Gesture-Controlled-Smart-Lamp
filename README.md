# Gesture-Controlled-Smart-Lamp
The Gesture-Controlled Smart Lamp project enables users to control a lamp using hand gestures. An ultrasonic sensor detects specific motions, triggering a relay to turn the lamp on or off. This hands-free system offers a simple, intuitive solution for controlling lighting, ideal for smart home applications.
